Hello! This is test dialogue.
Each line here will appear in a seperate line in the game.

A break in lines will require an input to continue past.
The following line means that the player is prompted with that many options.

>2
>So what?

Each option will be given following an arrow.
All text between that option and the next will be shown only if the player chooses that option.

>1
>Nesting?
Yup, nesting these works.
>

>I see...

To exit out of a choice (to end it) just put another arrow underneath.

>

{Text in curly brackets seperated by a bar|will be shown at random.
|
A new line cannot be used in place of a bar, but if you put a bar in the new line it will work.}

These can also be used in the {middle|midst|between} other text in a line.

{Doubling up|Using them twice} in one line {works too|also works}.
